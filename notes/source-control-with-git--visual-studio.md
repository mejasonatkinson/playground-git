### GIT SCM

- [Documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation)
- [Book](https://git-scm.com/book)
- [Video](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-git)
- [Cheat Sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)

VS Code will use your machine's Git installation, so you need to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/download) first before you get these features.

The Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the left will always indicate an overview of how many changes you currently have in your repository. Selecting the icon will show you the details of your current repository.

Clicking each item will show you in detail the textual changes within each file.

You can also access all git commands from the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
