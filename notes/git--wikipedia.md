# [Git; Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

Git is a **distributed version control system** that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for **coordinating work** among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. 

Git was originally authored by **Linus Torvalds** in **2005** for development of the **Linux kernel**, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. **Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer**.

## History

Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to **BitKeeper**, after complicated copyright claims broke out between BitKeeper and **SourcePuller**. This same dispute spured the creation of **Mercurial**.
