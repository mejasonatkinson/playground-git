## [Git Getting Started](https://www.w3schools.com/git/git_getstarted.asp?remote=github)

You can download Git for free from the following website: https://www.git-scm.com/

To check if Git is properly installed, run the following command in the terminal: `git --version`

If it returns a version (`git version X.Y`) then Git is installed correctly.

It is important to configure git, so it knows who you are. This can be done by running the following commands:

`git config --global user.name "first-name-last-name"`

`git config --global user.email "name@company.com"`

The keyword global is used to set the global values for the name and email for every repo. you can remove the `--global` keyword if you only want to set the values for the name and email address, for the repo you are in.

----
*The following is Git commands, and are just common terminal commands*

User `mkdir` to make a directory/new folder

`mkdir myproject`

Use `cd` to change directory/move to the new folder

`cd myproject`
----

You can then start/initialize Git by running

`git init`
